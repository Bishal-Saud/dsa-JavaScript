# Tree and Recursion

## What is Tree ?

`A DS tree is a fundamental hierarchical data structure. it represents a collection of elements(data) called nodes connected by edges (links forming a tree like structure)`

### Full tree

`Each node either has no children (leaf node) or exactly two children`

### Perfect Tree

`Full + Balance All the leaf nodes are at the same depth (distance from the root ). this means the tree is completely filled with no gaps at any level`

### Complete Tree

`Almost Full levels: All levels except possibly the last one and completely filled with nodes.`
`Left Learning last Level: The last level is filled with nodes from the left side as much as possible there might be empty spaces on the right`

## BST (Binary Search Tree)

`A BST is a special kind of binary tree used to organize data in a sorted way. It works like to filling cabinet where you can efficiently search,add,or remove items`

`Note: Go left if your value is smaller then the current branch Go right if your value is bigger`

# Recursion

`Recursion is when a function calls itself But it doesn't call itself exactly the same way each time`
`The function makes the problem smaller by changing the input a bit. Like opening a smaller doll inside the bigger one`
`There's a simple case, that the function can solve without calling itself again, This is called the baseCase(The smallest doll)`
`As long as it's not the base case the function calls itself with the smaller problem`
